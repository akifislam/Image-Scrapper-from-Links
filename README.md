<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This repository is just a handbook to scrape or download images from a text file containing list of links. You do not need any python or scraping library to do that. All you need just a txt file with links and a terminal command (curl , wget etc).


### Built With

* GNU wget
* A text file containing links

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

First create a text file (.txt) which contains the links of the images to be downloaded. All the links must be seperated by a newline.

### Prerequisites

You need to have installed wget or curl in your terminal to execute the terminal command. By default, Ubuntu or linux-based operating systems have wget.

* Now write on the terminal : wget -i <textfile_name>. Suppose 'images.txt' will contain all the links. Then,
  ```sh
  wget -i images.txt
  ```
